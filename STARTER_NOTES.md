Notes for Google Account article (February 23rd 2021)

Google Accounts are restricted by Google

Upon termination of YouTube accounts and parts of the service, the user can be restricted from their data and uploads

Google has become increasingly malicious with its identification of users, going from the rate of new accounts to a phone number verification to (recently) Credit card information and ID

Google Takeout is a good way to get your data out of your account before you delete it, but there are still some problems with Google Takeout:

* 1. All metadata is stripped from files during the archive process (information like the location, the camera used to take it, etc.) is scrubbed from the archive you download

* 2. The archive process can take a while, and will not always give you everything like it is supposed to (such as some missing content, and the inability to download Google Sites)

* 3. The archive process only gives you 7 days to download. If your account is over 1 terabyte (or requires more memory than you have left for the month) and you live with Comcast, this is simply impossible due to their 1 terabyte monthly datacap (data caps are a real problem)
